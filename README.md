# Mall Customer Segmentation

This repository contains code and resources for a customer segmentation analysis using the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about customers at a mall, including their age, annual income, spending score, and other attributes. The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their characteristics, which can help the mall develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

1. The original dataset file `Mall_Customers.csv`.
2. `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
